# Concordance Interface

This project is a concordance interface that allows users to perform various functions and queries on a database using a graphical user interface (GUI).

Ö³# Technologies Used
Backend: Python
Frontend: Tkinter
Database: SQL Server Management Studio (SMSS)
Libraries: Pandas, Pyodbc, NLTK

# Features
The concordance interface includes the following functions:
Searching for specific words or phrases in the database
Displaying concordance lines for a given word or phrase
Generating a word frequency list
Generating a collocation list
The interface also allows users to specify certain parameters for the above functions, such as the number of concordance lines to display or the number of words to include in the frequency list.

# Setup
To run the project, you will need to have the following software installed:

# Python 3
SQL Server Management Studio (SMSS)
Tkinter
Pandas, Pyodbc, NLTK libraries
Clone or download the project repository.
Open the project in your preferred Python IDE.
Connect to your SQL Server instance using SMSS and import the data to the database.
In the Python code, update the connection string with your server name and database name.
Run the project.

# Usage
On the main interface, specify the parameters for your query (e.g. word/phrase to search for, number of concordance lines to display).
Select the appropriate function from the options available (e.g. "Search", "Concordance", "Frequency List", "Collocation").
The results will be displayed in the interface.
Note
The interface uses the NLTK library's concordance function to generate concordance lines.
The data in the interface is hardcoded for demonstration purpose only, you can use your own data for real-world application.
The connection string and the data fields should be updated accordingly based on your database.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of Python, Tkinter, and SQL Server to create a concordance interface that allows users to perform various functions and queries on a database. The interface provides an easy-to-use graphical user interface for users to interact with the data. This project can be used as a starting point for further development and customization to suit specific needs.
